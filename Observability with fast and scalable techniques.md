# Microservices Background

Traditional applications were built as monolithic, single unit applications. To address increasing or decreasing load, monoliths can horizontally scale by deploying more instances of the entire application. Some issues with the monolithic architecture style include development cycles of distinct components being tied together, having to rebuild and redeploy the entire application at each cycle (often with entirely unchanged components), and scaling the entire application (as opposed to just the components that are facing changes in load).
# Kubernetes Background

The different components in a microservices architecture are called *Services*.
